</div>

## How does it work?
- User login/signUp to the app using their credentials.
- After signUp/login, they are presented with the home screen that shows closest food banks based on their current location.
- User are provided with a map section which works as a guide to places they could deliver the food.
- After delivering the food, they can see their delivery history in their profile section.
